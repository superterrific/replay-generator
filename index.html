          <h2>2009 Preakness Call by Dave Rodman</h2>
          <p>And they're off in the 134th running of the Preakness Stakes! A solid start for them all including the filly Rachel Alexandra and she's going right toward the lead with Friesian Fire and Big Drama who's racing well off the inside there. Big Drama off the fence there in about the two or three paths but Rachel Alexandra is going to run right with her (sic) to the first turn here at Pimlico and 134th Preakness Friesian Fire. is third Pioneerof the Nile racing fourth and Take the Points wide out in fifth. Papa Clem riding the rails followed by General Quarters, Musket Man is next, Tone It Down, the Maryland, hopeful is about seven or eight lengths off the lead. A break in the field to Flying Private to the back of the pack followed up by Luv Guv and Mine That Bird as they move on up the backstretch Terrain is back there as well.</p>

          <p>So up the backstretch they go. Rachel Alexandra's got a head in front after a quarter in 23, 46 and three for the half mile. She's got her ears up pricked, looking around, five eigths to go. A head in front from Big Drama second, in third there is Friesian Fire followed by Papa Clem, who tracks closely in fourth. General Quarters, Pioneerof the Nile is three wide racing along there in the sixth position. And it's Take the Points on the outside and Musket Man followed up by Terrain, who's got eight to make up into the far turn with three eights to go in the Preakness. </p>

          <p>And it is Rachel Alexandra looking to make Preakness history. And she says "if you want to beat me, you better come get me and get me right now". Calvin Borel and Rachel Alexandra given a bit of a cue, opening up with a quarter to go at Pimlico. Big Drama trying to hold on down in second there. Papa Clem is in between horses, Friesian Fire on the far outside laboring along with just about a furlong left to go. </p>

          <p>Rachel Alexandra she's got a three length lead here comes Musket Man! Musket Man charging, and Mine That Bird! On the far outside, the Derby winner Mine That Bird closing a late gap. But it is Rachel Alexandra, she is simply above and beyond them! A filly has won the Preakness! Mine That Bird was second, Musket Man was third, and in fourth position there was Flying Private, and the time was 1:55. We've seen history, a dazzling display by Rachel Alexandra well first filly will win the Preakness in 85 years!</p>
